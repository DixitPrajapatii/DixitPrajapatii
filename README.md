# Hi, I'm Dixit Prajapati 👋

## 🌟 Data Engineer | Cloud Enthusiast | Big Data Advocate 🌟

I am a passionate Data Engineer with a deep interest in transforming raw data into valuable insights. My expertise lies in building robust data pipelines, designing scalable ETL processes, and working with Big Data technologies to empower data-driven decision-making.

In the modern world, data is the new oil, and as a Data Engineer, I strive to refine and process this oil to fuel innovation. With experience in tools like **Azure Synapse Analytics, Databricks, Apache Spark, SQL, Python, AWS, and Postgres**, I am equipped to handle large datasets and complex data architectures. My journey in data engineering has allowed me to work with various data formats like **CSV, Parquet**, and engage in cloud processing using platforms like **Microsoft Azure** and **AWS**.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and apply them in real-world projects, continuously pushing the boundaries of what data can achieve.
